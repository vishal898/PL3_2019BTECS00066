            Mars at opposition

            That fiery orange spot is of course Mars and the pre-telescope imaginings above provide a picture of what’s happening in the sky right now and what will continue to unfold into October and early November. Mars won’t be this close or bright again until July 2033. And then in September 2035 even better views will be possible – trumping the viewing opportunities of Mars afforded back in 2018. Perhaps there’ll be boot prints in Martian dust by the time 2035 rolls around?

The ‘Red Planet’ (curiously more orange than red) will be at opposition on 13 October 2020. It will be at its closest approach on 6 October at just 62.1 million km from Earth. So, in the evenings be sure to look up to the northeast and wave ‘hello’ to Mars from September onwards right up until November. After this, it will fade quickly.

When a planet is at ‘opposition’, Earth is directly between it and the Sun, so together they form a line with Earth in the middle. Earth orbits the Sun about 25% faster than Mars, so every 26 months Earth overtakes Mars on the ‘inside lane’.

At this time, they are of course, closer together, so we see Mars not only much brighter but also larger when viewed through a telescope. Earth passes by Mars quite quickly, so the time for best telescope viewing is just a few weeks before and after the opposition.<aside>
               <h3>Martian dust storms and telescope viewing</h3>
               <p>Mars is well known for its dust storms. The larger ones can last from weeks to months and can even extend across the planet. These big storms typically only happen during Mars’ southern hemisphere summer.

                To understand why these Mars storms happen when they do, you need to think about the perihelion and aphelion again. Mars is nearly 10% closer to the Sun at perihelion than at aphelion and while this might not sound like much, it makes a difference. Planets move faster in their orbits during perihelion, and since Mars’ perihelia coincide with its southern hemisphere summers, the southern summers are short and hot (relatively speaking). It’s thought that these short hot summers give rise to seasonal dust storms every 26 months.
                
                Unfortunately, at the time of the 2018 opposition, a months-long planetwide dust storm was underway. Though the naked eye brightness of Mars wasn’t much affected, our telescope viewing definitely was! The surface details we’d hoped to observe, were sadly obscured by the storm. The storm also saw the demise of NASA’s Opportunity Rover. On the bright side, it created an unprecedented opportunity for the study of Martian dust storms!</p>
